<strong>Medieval ships</strong> were the vessels used in Europe during the Middle Ages. Like ships from antiquity, they were moved by sails, oars, or a combination of the two. There was a large variety, mostly based on much older, conservative designs. Although wider and more frequent communications within Europe meant exposure to a variety of improvements, experimental failures were costly and rarely attempted. Ships in the north were influenced by Viking vessels, while those in the south by classical or Roman vessels. However, there was technological change. The different traditions used different construction methods; clinker in the north, carvel in the south. By the end of the period, carvel construction would come to dominate the building of large ships. The period would also see a shift from the steering oar or side rudder to the stern rudder and the development from single-masted to multi-masted ships. As the area is connected by water, people in the Mediterranean built different kinds of ships to accommodate different sea levels and climates. Within the Mediterranean area during the Medieval times ships were used for a multitude of reasons, like war, trade, and exploration.

<h4>Early Middle Ages</h4>
<h5>Knarr</h5>
<pre><em>   Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr">Knarr</a>  </em></pre>
<p><strong>The knarr</strong>, a relative of the longship, was a type of cargo vessel used by the Vikings. It differed from the longship in that it was larger and relied almost entirely on its square-rigged sail for propulsion.</p>
<h4>High Middle Ages</h4>
<h5>Cog</h5>
<pre><em>    Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog_(ship)">Cog (ship)</a></em></pre>
<p><strong>Cogs</strong> were single-masted vessels, with clinker-built sides and a flush-planked, flat bottom</p>
<p>Although the name "cog" is recorded as early as the 9th century,[2] the seagoing vessel of that name seems to have evolved on the Frisian coast during the 14th century.[3] Cogs progressively replaced Viking-type ships in Northern waters during the 13th century. Why this was the case is uncertain but cogs could carry more cargo than knarr of a similar size. Their flat bottoms allowed them to settle flat in the harbor, making them easier to load and unload. Their high sides made them more difficult to board in a sea-fight, which may have made them safer from pirates.</p>
<p>Cogs were also used as military transports and warships, fitted with towers fore and aft.</p>
<p>The cog traditionally reached the Mediterranean in 1304. This led to a Mediterranean variant, the coach.</p>
<h5>Hulk</h5>
<pre><em>     Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(medieval_ship_type)">Hulk (medieval ship type)</a></em></pre>
<p><strong>The hulk</strong> (OE: hulc) is first recorded in the 10th century, when it is distinguished from a keel (OE: ceol), a ship in the Nordic tradition such as the knarr. Very little is known about the hulc, with no archaeological remains or usefully descriptive contemporary records. Early images of hulks show them strongly curved upwards at stem and stern.</p>
<p>Hulks continued to be mentioned in use throughout the Middle Ages and into the 16th century when it is particularly associated with the Baltic and the Hanseatic League. These late hulks could be as large as contemporary great ships. Jesus of LÃ¼beck of 1544 was a ship of 700 long tons (780 short tons; 710 t), the same as the Mary Rose.[7] However, how similar later medieval hulks were to their ancestors is unknown. There is some evidence of hybridization with the cog form, showing both hulk and post-construction.[8] Others have suggested that late hulks were partially carvel-built.</p>
